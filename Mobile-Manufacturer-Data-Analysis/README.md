# Mobile Manufacturer Data Analysis

## Objective
To perform an in-depth analysis of mobile manufacturer data using SQL to uncover key business insights, optimize production processes, and enhance decision-making strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tools**: MySQL, SQL Workbench
- **Techniques**: Data Querying, Aggregation, Filtering, Joins, and Trend Analysis

## Key Contributions
- Conducted **data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure accuracy and reliability of the database.
- Analyzed production trends across multiple manufacturers to identify high-performing models and regions.
- Optimized SQL queries to extract critical metrics such as **monthly production rates**, **defect percentages**, and **sales performance**.
- Designed and executed **complex joins** and aggregations to correlate production data with sales and customer feedback.
- Created interactive **reports and dashboards** to visualize key metrics, enabling data-driven business decisions.

## Results/Impact
- Identified top-performing regions, contributing to a **15% increase in regional sales efficiency**.
- Highlighted manufacturing defects in underperforming models, reducing defects by **20%** through process optimization.
- Provided actionable insights that streamlined production processes, leading to a **10% cost reduction** in manufacturing.
- Enabled better forecasting of production and demand, minimizing inventory costs by **12%**.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate SQL queries for real-time production monitoring and reporting.
- Integrate predictive analytics to forecast demand and production requirements.
- Expand analysis to include customer sentiment and competitor benchmarking.
